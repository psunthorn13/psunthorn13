<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Data Science Projects:</h2>
  
<h3> End-to-end Web App </h3>

- <b>[MenuAI Project](https://menuai-ed74390db92c.herokuapp.com/)</b>
  - Developed an AI-powered app offering menu image extraction, custom dish creation, and food photo analysis for an enhanced food experience.
  
  - Utilised computer vision, generative AI, and large language models (LLM) to extract information from images, including OCR for menu text extraction.
    
  - Implemented Docker for containerisation and utilised GitHub Actions to establish a CI/CD pipeline for seamless deployment and production readiness.
  
- <b>[Explainable AI](https://explainable-ai.herokuapp.com/)</b>
  - Developed an interactive tool that allows users to upload CSV files and select target variables to help them utilise the predictive power of machine learning with explainable ability.
  
  - Handled the data dynamically on  the website before putting it into the model.
  
  - Built a tree-based machine learning model with a model performance report without tuning to give a sense of how the baseline model performs and which features are essential to the model.
  
  - Used SHAP with visualisation to see how each feature impacts to the model.
  
  - Deployed this website through the cloud (Heroku).

- <b>[Social Listening for Crypto Market](https://social-listening-for-cryptos.herokuapp.com/)</b>
  - Developed a tool that helps investors analyse online cryptocurrency conversations in real-time.
  
  - Used natural language processing(NLP) and machine learning to analyse crypto sentiment.
  
  - Implemented end-to-end machine learning application by collecting data from Twitter API in real-time,  processing unstructured text data, using the model for sentimental analysis, visualising through the interactive web app and deploying to the cloud.

  
- <b>[Sentiment Analysis on Federal Open Market Committee(FOMC) minutes](https://sentiment-analysis-on-fomc.herokuapp.com/)</b>
  
  - Developed a tool that analysed updated Federal Open Market Committee(FOMC) minutes from US Federal Reserve meetings, which discussed economic issues such as inflation, unemployment and economic growth. 

  - Implemented end-to-end machine learning application by collecting data from official FED website scraping in real-time,  processing unstructured text data, using the model for sentimental analysis, visualising through the interactive web app and deploying to the cloud.

- <b>[Zer0greenhouse](https://github.com/psunthorn13/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/DS%20Presentation.pdf)</b>
  - Developed a website that provides innovative features to help people in the City of Melbourne reduce greenhouse using an agile approach with 3 iterations. (Won a prize as an Expo Winner).

  - Utilised Python to automate data collection and wrangling by connecting APIs from several sources (more than 7 different open sources), cleansing structured and unstructured data, and using the ETL process to interact with database and website.

  - Deployed a deep learning image classification model (built from 20K images with 11 classes) to the website that allows users to input food images and returns CO2 emission analysis along with suggestions about reducing CO2 from food consumption. (Green Food)

  - Built an emission map that helps users plan their journey with the smallest amount of emission using Mapbox APIs and open data about emission by car model. (Green Transport Map)


  - This is part of the features in final project called [Green Transport Map](https://6nm4i6wdvuc57bgh.anvil.app/P55UHAAQQIYESFP7Z5GAFCJ2)


- <b>[Government Measures for COVID-19 (RShiny)](https://psunthorn13.shinyapps.io/COVID-Dashboard/)</b>
  - Developed interactive dashboard by using Rshiny (R package that uses to build interactive web apps) along with Plotly (open source for data visualisation library).

  - Performed data collection and wrangling by scraping the website, downloading data from different sources and using scripts to automate the data cleansing process.

  - Provided analysis and exciting insight about worldwide COVID-19 measures and how best practice countries handled the situation.
