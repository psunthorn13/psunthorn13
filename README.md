<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Data Science Projects:</h2>
  
<h3> End-to-end Web App </h3>
  
- <b>[Explainable AI](https://explainable-ai.herokuapp.com/)</b>
  - Developed an interactive tool that allows users to upload CSV files and select target variables to help them utilise the predictive power of machine learning with explainable ability.
  - Handled the data dynamically on  the website before putting it into the model
  - Built a tree-based machine learning model with a model performance report without tuning to give a sense of how the baseline model performs and which features are essential to the model
  - Used SHAP with visualisation to see how each feature impact to the model.
  - Deployed this website through the cloud (Heroku)
